# Homonymy-polysemy-in-dictionaries
The data set comprises distances between nominal senses in polysemy networks made for 57 nouns picked up from WordNet and two English dictionaries, namely Oxford Lexico (LEX), www.lexico.com, and Merriam-Webster (MW), www.merriam-webster.com.

Polysemy networks were made manually on the basis of each dictionary entry. Then meanings of Princeton WordNet nouns were mapped onto dictionary senses. The mapping was done independently by two lexicographers with Cohen's kappa greater than 0.80. For all possible pairs of senses we calculated Dijkstra's distances (distMW, distLEX).

We applied the correction with regard to missed senses. For details see M. Maziarz, F. Bond, E. Rudnicka, Testing agreement between lexicographers: A case of homonymy and polysemy, In: Proceedings of the 11th Global Wordnet Conference, Pretoria, South Africa, Jan 18-21, 2021.
